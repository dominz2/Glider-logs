# Gliders logs

This app downloads all logs from flights from [crosscountryaero](http://www.crosscountry.aero).

To make it work you need to:
* Create your own account on this page and change login and password in code (line 23, 24)
* Download chromedriver and set path to it (line 11)
* Set preferred download location (line 9)
* Create anaconda env from selenium.yml (if you don't use anaconda pip install selenium should be enough)
